Hi! I'm Patrick Canfield. I make art out of necessity. I'm particularly interested in visual arts that have a narrative, like comics, or are interactive, like video games. I have a background in software engineering which I now leverage in my pursuit of artistic excellence. Currently seeking pro bono work in not-for-profit contexts or paid work elsewise.
