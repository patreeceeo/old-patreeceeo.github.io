# Patrick Canfield
<me@patrickcanfield.com>

Though extremely comfortable with writing code, my sights are set on a position that involves coding, creativity, collaboration and mentoring (and being mentored) in equal portions.

Every developer strives to write correct code as fast as possible. I also prefer my code to be as much an artifact for human beings per se as instructions to be executed by a computer.
