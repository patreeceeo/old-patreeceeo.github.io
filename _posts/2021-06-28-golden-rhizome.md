A thought I had in the shower the other day: The default, natural relation between people is love, it's only when our ego, which surfaces as fear or selfishness, gets in the way that any other type of relation is a possibility. Some people got thorns or they've been molded in such a way that makes them harder to love, but that's not a refutation of this golden fuzz. When someone's harder to love, isn't it fear of being (further) hurt or made uncomfortable that makes it hard? Not that I'm naive, there are folks out there who will eat you alive if you let them. Those folks are relatively few, however, and this world needs more love, so as long as I keep my wits about me I think this fuzzy notion is a firm place to stand.
